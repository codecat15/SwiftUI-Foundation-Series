# SwiftUI-Foundation-Series
Welcome to MyTask, a SwiftUI-based Todo list app built with Core Data integration. This GitHub repository serves as a companion to my YouTube tutorial series where I walk you through the development process of MyTask step by step.

In this tutorial series, you'll learn the fundamentals of SwiftUI, explore the power of Core Data for data persistence, and understand how to build a fully functional task management app from scratch. Each tutorial episode will cover a specific aspect of the app's development, ensuring you gain practical skills and insights along the way.

# MyTask - SwiftUI Todo List App

MyTask is a Todo list app developed using SwiftUI and Core Data. It offers a simple and intuitive interface to help you manage your tasks efficiently. This repository contains the source code and resources for the MyTask app, organized based on the corresponding tutorial episodes released on my YouTube channel.

# Prerequisuite

This will provide you with a solid understanding of the building blocks of SwiftUI and familiarize you with some essential property wrappers used in the foundation series. If you haven't watched the beginner series yet, I encourage you to do so.
